Hello
This Project is about parallel implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm in Nvidia Cuda.
What I have actually done is I have generated the random graph, there are two types of random graph 
1) Fully Connected 2) Normal Graph with node degree K
Then I have calculated shortest distance from source node to all other vertices using Dijkstra algorithm in Cuda parallel
and in C++ serially.

For Running Code- 
Run the random graph generator code in c++ compiler just provide a input file to it than an output file will be generated that output file is used as input for below two codes
just copy the parallel code in visual studio integrated with nvidia cuda
and serial code in codeblocks or any other c++ compiler
